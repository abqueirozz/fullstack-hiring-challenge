## Your Task

Your task is to create a registration form using Django. We estimate this will take 4-5 hours for a person who is familiar with the technology stack. The application skeleton and instructions are well prepared, but expect extra 5-8 hours if you are not familiar with Django or React. The technology stack is the same that you will be using in when working us.

#### Features
* Create account
* Login
* Logout
* Change email or password

### Back-end



### Front-end
You can develop frond-end using React or native Django Template Render.


## How your exercise submission will be ranked

We will look:

* If the task was correctly completed
* Clean code
* Visual quality of the user interface changes - the layouts must look professional, not broken
* Unit Testing and Integration Testing
* Documentation (README and code comments)

## Delivery

Please upload your code to a repository we can access and let us know when it's ready. If possible, deploy the code onto some remote server so it's working too.

Don't worry about getting everything pixel perfect, the goal is to make sure you can handle tools and build custom interfaces, navigation, state management and have the general engineering knowledge to solve the problems at hand.
